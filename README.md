# gym_split

My app is called GymSplit and it's basically a way for people to keep track of their splits.

A gym split or workout split is how you divide up your workouts throughout the week 
either by muscle group, movement, or specific body part.

This approach allows bodybuilders and everyday gym goers to make sure that each muscle group is being targeted.

It has been shown that following these splits overtime results in optimal muscle growth.

For example when I went to the gym....

At first I tried writing what I did each day on my calendar app, but that was not efficient at 
all because you have to add so much unnecessary info since you are essentially creating an event.

Then I tried writing in my notes app which is what most people do. It wasn't as bad as the calendar, but it was still inefficient and hard to quickly edit and move around text.

So this is how I thought of creating a simple app that would allow me to keep track of my splits



## What I implemented and what I plan on adding 

My app consists of just a few pages as of now. I also have navigation buttons on each page and my app consists mostly of ListView and ListTile.

There is still a lot more to be done, for example connecting it to a firbase database.
